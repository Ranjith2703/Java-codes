You are given an integer array arr[] that denotes the prices of inividual toys. You are also given an amount k that is the total money you have. You need to maximize the number of toys you can have with the k amount.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1], k = 8
Output: 3
Explanation: With k=8 amount, you can purchase toys with prices 3 2 1 so total of 3 toys.
Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k = 15
Output: 5
Explanation: With k=15 amount, you can purchase all the toys.



class Solution {
    public static int max_toys(int arr[], int k) {
        // Your code here
        int c=0;
        int s=0;
        Arrays.sort(arr);
        for(int i:arr){
            s+=i;
            if(s<=k){
                c++;}
        }
        return c;
        
    }
}
