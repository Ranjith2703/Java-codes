Problem statement
Aryan and his friends are very fond of the pattern. For a given integer ‘N’, they want to make the N-Binary Number Triangle.

You are required to print the pattern as shown in the examples below.

Example:
Input: ‘N’ = 3

Output: 

1
0 1
1 0 1


public class Solution {
    public static void nBinaryTriangle(int n) {
        // Write your code here.
        int s=1;
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            if(i%2==0) s=1;
            else s=0;
            for(int j=0;j<=i;j++){
                System.out.print(s+" ");
                s=1-s;
            }
            System.out.println();
        }
    }
}
